              Proudly, the majority of our collections are made locally in
              Australia. While the brand first started with a focus on Merino
              wool basics, designed to layer, the fashion collection has evolved
              into a complete ready to wear range of designer womenswear. Our
              enduring designs are made to last for years to come and be
              wardrobe staples that you will turn to time and again. Viktoria &
              Woods winter and summer collections include tailored suiting,
              blazers, denim, loungewear, knitwear, dresses, tops, and modern
              event wear. The range also includes footwear, jewellery and
              additions to complete your outfit styling. <br />
